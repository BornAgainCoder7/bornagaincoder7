Hello, world! My name is Christopher Bueker.

I am a technical SEO, cybersecurity, and web engineering consultant, and the founder of SunPath SEO.

I focus on building, testing, and validating websites using first-principles engineering, modern SEO standards, and command-line tooling. I like working close to the system, where truth is observable and measurable.
